        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm a junior developer, on a constant search for satisfaction.  I try to make the most of my time, and stay busy with music and gaming.</p>
        
        <p>I'm a graduate of the University of Central Florida, and received a BA in Digital Media: Game Design with a minor in Computer science.  During my time at UCF, I evolved my developer skills working with teams on complex game projects.  Have a stronger programming background than most, I focused on implementing mechanic and game logic that could be harnassed by artists and level designers.</p>
        
        <p>I really enjoy making music in my free time.  I find it's the thing that I'm best at, and get the most enjoyment out of.  I feel very relaxed when I sit down and play whatever comes to mind on the guitar.  I appreciate the freedom I've built up on the instrument over time.  I like coming up with song structures, and have finally obtained all the gear I need to get my ideas down.</p>
        
        <p>I also enjoy some quality video game time.</p>
